# Overview

This script describes the helper and core functions that make up the **Global Brain Health Institute (GBHI) Resource Allocation Model (GRAM)**, a microsimulation model that portrays the natural progression of dementia, simulating individual trajectories across various attributes over time. The model is adapted from IPECAD 1.2.

# 1. Generic Helpers

## Adjust Probabilities

**Description**

Adjusts probabilities from one time frame to another (e.g., from monthly to annual) and/or for a given risk ratio.

**Usage**

`f.adjustprobability(p, t_new, t_old, RR)`

**Arguments**

`p` Probability to be adjusted

`t_new` Targeted time period

`t_old` Current time period

`RR` Risk ratio

**Details**

The given probability `p` is first converted to a rate, then adjusted for time and risk ratio, and finally converted back to a probability.

**Value**

A numeric value containing the new probability.

## Sample from a categorical variable

**Description**

Samples from a categorical variable using pre-defined uniform random values. The function supports both vector and matrix formats for probabilities and allows optional mapping of categories to specific values.

**Usage**

`f.qcat(p_rand, p_cat, values = NULL)`

**Arguments**

`p_rand` A vector of random values drawn from a uniform distribution (0,1). Used to assign categories based on probabilities.

`p_cat` A vector or matrix of probabilities representing the distribution of the categorical variable. If vector, probabilities for each category, summing to 1. If matrix, columns represent probability distributions for independent trials, with each column summing to 1.

`values` Optional vector of values corresponding to categories in `p_cat`. Must be the same length as `p_cat` (if a vector) or the number of rows in `p_cat` (if a matrix). If `NULL`, defaults to sequential integers starting from 1.

**Details**

For vector `p_cat`, the function checks that:

1.  The probabilities sum to 1 (with tolerance for rounding errors).

2.  The length of p_cat matches values if provided.

3.  Probabilities of 0 or 1 are slightly shifted to avoid errors in categorization.

For matrix `p_cat`, the function checks that:

1.  Each column sums to 1.

2.  The number of rows matches the length of values, if provided.

3.  The number of columns matches the length of p_rand.

4.  The function uses cut() for vector inputs and manual indexing for matrix inputs to assign categories based on cumulative probabilities.

**Value**

A vector of sampled categories corresponding to `p_rand`.

For vector `p_cat`, returns values mapped to the defined probabilities. For matrix `p_cat`, returns a vector of sampled categories, one for each column of `p_cat`. Returns `NULL` for invalid input or issues during processing.

## Discounting

**Description**

Applies discounting to a scalar, vector, or matrix over a specified number of cycles, based on a given discount rate.

**Usage**

`f.discount(x, discount_rate, n.cycle)`

**Arguments**

`x` A scalar, vector, or matrix to be discounted.

`discount_rate` The annual discount rate, expressed as a decimal (e.g., 0.03 for 3%).

`n.cycle` The number of cycles over which discounting is applied.

**Details**

Divides the input `x` by a discount factor calculated as `(1 + discount_rate)^t`, where `t` represents the cycle index (0 to `n.cycle - 1`).

If `x` is a matrix, discounting is applied element-wise, assuming each row corresponds to a time period.

**Value**

A matrix containing the discounted values of `x`.
