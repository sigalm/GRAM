This document lists data inputs for the GRAM model that require external
sourcing. Internal model definitions are excluded; model parameters are
defined in `gram_01setup.R`.

The model is currently set up to use data from the United States. If you
are using the model in a different setting, you will need to adjust the
data inputs accordingly, including defining a cohort that represents the
population of interest. There are two ways to do this:

1.  **Define distributions for each individual attribute** (e.g., age,
    sex, education, etc.) for your population of interest. GRAM will
    create a synthetic population by randomly assigning attributes to
    individuals based on the distributions. This information might be
    easier to source in some settings. However, the dependencies between
    attributes (e.g., age and sex) will need to be accounted for, which
    will require revisions to the model and may not always be possible
    if data on associations between attributes are not available.

2.  **Read in an individual-level dataset** that represents your
    population of interest (e.g., census microdata). Ensure that the
    dataset includes all attributes defined in the model. GRAM will use
    the dataset to simulate the population of interest. This is the
    preferred option if such individual-level data are available.
